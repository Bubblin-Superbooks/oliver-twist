<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">have been a married woman, ma'am, and I may mention it to youâ€”a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer's door when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney. As he wouldn't go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal. "My heart!" says the ungrateful villain, "what's the use of <em>this</em> to me? You might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!" "Very good," says our overseer, taking 'em away again, "you won't get anything else here." "Then I'll die in the streets!" says the vagrant. "Oh no, you won't," says our overseer.'</p><p>'Ha! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn't it?' interposed the matron. 'Well, Mr. Bumble?'</p><p>'Well, ma'am,' rejoined the beadle, 'he went away; and he <em>did</em> die in the streets. There's a obstinate pauper for you!'</p></div> </div>
